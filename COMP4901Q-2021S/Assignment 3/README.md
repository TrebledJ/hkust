# COMP4901Q: Assignment 3
## Compiling
This is the basic command to compile and run the program. Ensure that the hosts in the hostfile are known hosts.

```
$ mpic++ -I. -I../utils -std=c++11 main.cpp -D PRINT_OUTPUT && mpiexec --hostfile hostfile -n 8 ./a.out
```

Configure the program by specifying the following compilation flags:
* `-D RUNS=100`. Specify the number of runs. By default, this value is 10.
* `-D PROBLEM=1`. Specify which problems to run. You can run both problems by using `-D PROBLEM=12`. By default, both problems 1 and 2 are run.
* `-D PRINT_OUTPUT`. Controls whether output is printed. However, even if activated, output will only be printed if the input is small to avoid cluttering the terminal.
* `-D RANDOM_LO=1.0`. Specify the lower bound of numbers to be generated. By default, this is 1.0.
* `-D RANDOM_HI=10.0`. Specify the upper bound of numbers to be generated. By default, this is 10.0.
