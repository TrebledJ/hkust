# COMP3031: Principles of Programming Languages

Period: 2021 Fall

Solutions for COMP3031 assignments. See [past-papers](../past-papers/) for the corresponding assignment descriptions (and also some past papers).

This course gives a tour of functional/procedural languages as well as grammars using Standard ML, Prolog, and Bison.

Lost a mark on Assignment 2 (see commit ac89635 for the fix). Other assignments were all good.
