# HKUST COMP2011 Spring 2020

My solutions to COMP2011 Spring 2020 labs and assignments. Showcases modern (C++17), robust, unnecessarily overkill solutions to simple programs. For [anybody's] reference.

No over-overkill solutions for Lab 1 and 2 due to late enrollment.

Official TA solutions have filenames suffixed with `_sol`.
