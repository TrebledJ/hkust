# COMP2011: Programming with C++

Period: 2020 Spring

My solutions to COMP2011 labs and assignments. Showcases modern (C++17), robust, unnecessarily overkill solutions to simple programs. For anybody's reference.

Official TA solutions have filenames suffixed with `-sol`.

Probably the most interesting file here is `lab_helpers.hpp`, which I have painstakingly taken time to comment.
