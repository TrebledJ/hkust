# COMP4901Q: High Performance Computing

Period: 2021 Spring

Interesting course all about splitting tasks to achieve faster speed.

If you take this course, don't make the same mistake as I did and make sure you choose a SUITABLE project topic that can be sped up via threads and task splitting. Don't be like me and choose a stupid topic and being hopeless in the project.
